live bus tracker animation 

** description**

this project utilizes several elements of working with DOM - we are also getting our map from the back end with our self-created Access Token through mapbox GL.
we are setting the buses as an array, displaying them using our css file, pulling in live data from MBTA to display every 15 seconds, the locations of several buses.  

*this one i had trouble getting the bus markers to display, though my javascript is working just fine. i am trouble shooting this w/ Shaker today, sent him my whole html file and hopefully will hear something back very soon.  

** coming**

i hope to use this same approach in future repos, specifically to animate web pages but also to build applications utilizing the full manipulation offered by these very powerful javascript expressions and loops.  this project is exciting for me personally, as i am very interested in public transportation and helping modernize that and make it more efficent in our american cities.
